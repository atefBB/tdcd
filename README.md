### TDCD: Test Driven Component Development

An example repo to demonstrate applying TDD to developing React components. The
repo consists of step-wise branches to build a Todo app. Each branch has an
empty component file and matching test file for the comonent being built at that
step, plus an example implementation of the previous step where applicable,

The implementations are just possible solutions, yours need not match, the point
of this repo is to practice TDD with React

### 1 Todo
Build a component to hold a single task in a list of tasks.

### 2 TodoInput
Build a component for a user to enter a new task

### 3 BottomNav
Build a component to toggle between all, active, and done tasks

### 4 Todos
Build a component to show a list of tasks, add new ones, and toggle between task
types

### 5 App
Add the Todos component to the main app file, and load it in a browser. It
should work, even if it looks bad

### 6 Completed
Holds an example completed Todo application, with improved appearance.
